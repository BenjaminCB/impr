- Could have jest returned triple_taken && double_taken in the full house function. It would be a smarter solution but it wouldn't be in the same style as the function that return the score
- could probably have used padding on the score board to make it look better
- could use fgets to make the input easier to handle when the user doesn't do the corret thing.
- c90 forbids variable lenght arrays like dice[n_dice]
- personally i like having loop variables right before the loop but i have tried to follow pedantic rules c90 so for the most part every variable is at the top of the block
