- Could have jest returned triple_taken && double_taken in the full house function. It would be a smarter solution but it wouldn't be in the same style as the function that return the score
- could probably have used padding on the score board to make it look better
- could use fgets to make the input easier to handle when the user doesn't do the corret thing.
- c90 forbids variable lenght arrays like dice[n_dice]
- personally i like having loop variables right before the loop but i have tried to follow pedantic rules c90 so for the most part every variable is at the top of the block
- should use malloc to initalize dice array

- is EOF case even neccesary in response function
- n_dice only needs to be declared instead of initalized
- instead of having roll_print_count calling three functions that each go throuh n_dice i could probably combine them down into one for loop instead three there reducing the time complexity a lot espacially since n_dice can get quite big however printing might as well be the bottleneck
- using rolls enum in the counting function could be a little confusing
- could probably use a single print in print_scoreboard
- after callig full_house function forget to add to the sum afterwards
